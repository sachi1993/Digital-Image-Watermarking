## A Hybrid Watermarking Scheme Using DWT and Haar Transform for Image Authentication ðŸ‘‹
## Abstract
<p>The safe transfer and preservation of medical images is crucial in the age of digital healthcare. Watermarking medical images is an essential method of adding patient data, hospital logos, and other pertinent information to these images without compromising their confidentiality, integrity, or validity. To overcome the aforementioned difficulties, this abstract offers a unique and reliable medical image watermarking system that makes use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approaches. There are three main phases to the suggested plan. The medical image is first broken down into its frequency components using DWT, which makes watermark embedding more effective. Subsequently, the PSO method is utilized to maximize the choice of image segments for incorporation, guaranteeing that the watermark remains undetectable and robust against diverse attacks. In the last step, the watermarkâ€™s strength is increased by using the SVD approach to embed it in the singular values of certain image blocks. Comprehensive tests are conducted to assess the efficacy of the suggested approach, taking into account performance measures like the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), as well as resistance against typical assaults such as noise addition, compression, and cropping. The testing findings show that the method effectively embeds the watermark while maintaining image quality and making sure it is robust to attack.</p>
